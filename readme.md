Program for determining the winner of two standard five card poker hands.
Program was written in java 12 under the assumption that user input will be passed as a command line argument in the exact format:
[player1_name]: [card1] [cards2] [card3] [card4] [card5] [player2_name]: [card1] [card2] [card3] [card4] [card5]
player names cannot contain spaces, cards are in the format of [rank][suit] with no space, each consisting of exactly 1 character.
availible ranks are: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ,7, 8, 9. T, J, Q, K, A}
and availible suits are: {H, S, D, C}
code for aditional functionality such as generating and comparing random five card hands is included, but not implemented.
